# Employee Management App
## Description
On this application you'll be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete any Employee profile, like a standard CRUD application.
<br>
In order to facilitate the delete and edit profile there is a filter on the page, you can enter any word belonging to any field, separeted by spaces.
<br>
<br>
## How it works
If you want to search for an Engineer called Nicholas, do it as displayed on the image:

<br>
<br>
The displayed page can be changed, from 1 to the limit number.
<br>
The number of Employees per page also can be changed, the limit is the number of registered Employees, the default value is ten employees.

<br>
<br>
Each row of the table has two options: Edit and Delete.
<br>
* Delete: by clicking on delete will remove the user of the selected row of the system.
* Edit: by clicking on edit you'll be redirected to a new screen, to insert the data to be displayed.

<br>
<br>
At last but not least, you can add a new Employee by clicking on "Add Employee" and fill the form that will be displayed.

<br>
<br>
I still haven't build a Form Validation so please, behave yourself and fill the fields properly, comrade!
<br>
The main component of this application is a Table so I didn't made it resposive for Cellphones and small screens, the best user experience will be at 600px and above.
